# `btt-touchbar-zoomonair`

An ON AIR sign in your MacBook touch bar taking the microphone status from Zoom. When muted, a small grey muted indicator is displayed... but when you're unmuted and about to make a fool of yourself, a big red ON AIR display is shown on your touch bar hopefully getting your attention before it's too late.

Requires [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai). It's cheap and super powerful. Go support BTT if you're not already.

In BTT, add a Touch Bar item of type "Apple Script / Javascript Widget" and paste the contents of `btt-touchbar-zoomonair.applescript` into the script window. Set how often you want the widget to update using the "Execute script every..." option. (I have it set to update every 0.5s.)

Tested with BTT v3.553.
